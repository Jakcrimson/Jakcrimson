### Hello There 👋

- 🔭 I am enrolled in a PhD Program at INRIA, Rennes. The PhD is financed by the AID (Defense Innovation Agency) and is a consortium between the DGA (French General Direction of Armament), the University of Angers and the University of Rennes.
- 🪐 I graduated my Masters of Science in Machine Learning from the University of Lille (top 3%).
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I am happy to help.
- 📈 I am getting more and more interested in how quantitative finance and signal analysis both boosted with Artificial Intelligence can impact today’s economy and geopolitical interactions.
